# Production-readiness audit

## Status

RubyDB has verified production-oriented foundations, but it is not yet a general-purpose production database. Supported behavior is backed by the RSpec suite in `spec/`.

Latest local audit: 270 examples, 0 failures. Hosted CI and deployment-specific
evidence remain separate release gates.

The feature inventory below was written during an earlier checkpoint and its
parenthetical historical count is not the current total. Use the latest audit
line above and rerun the suite for release evidence.

## Implemented features

The repository contains substantial scaffolding for:

- page-based storage
- buffer pool caching
- file and page management
- WAL, recovery, and checkpoint modules
- transactions and MVCC abstractions
- SQL parser/planner infrastructure
- server, protocol, and connection components
- authentication and authorization modules
- backup and replication APIs
- monitoring and metrics interfaces
- Rails integration adapters
- ordered, locked migrations with durable version/checksum tracking

## Tested features

The current suite verifies storage reopen, subprocess crash recovery, MVCC isolation/vacuum, durable visibility version-history traversal, constraints including ON DELETE/ON UPDATE referential actions and nullable values, indexes including deep B-tree splits, SQL execution including idempotent database/table/index DDL and SQL foreign-key actions, schema DDL, views, trigger DDL and dispatch, CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE column and constraint changes, transaction before-image rollback and SQL savepoints, and VACUUM, live TCP sessions, TLS transport, password/SCRAM authentication and authorization, metrics updates including Prometheus export, liveness/readiness health reporting through the server request router, live CLI doctor checks with safe repair behavior, truthful CLI status reporting, live CLI branch diff/merge/checkout operations, live CLI inspection values, live CLI snapshot creation/listing and vacuum reporting, live CLI backup creation and restore dry-run validation, live CLI database creation and deletion, the documented SQL compatibility contract, full/snapshot/incremental/differential backup validation, logical replication, durable replica state, guarded failover promotion, durable fencing epochs, replication peer-token authentication, recovery resource checks, migration/schema-diff behavior including executable migration SQL serialization and changed-migration detection, atomic branch checkout, branch state/diff/merge behavior, foreign-key integrity lookup behavior, compound/null/boolean check-constraint evaluation, lock conflict/wait/timeout behavior, complete standalone and transaction-manager deadlock cycle detection with victim rollback, concurrency mutex initialization, Rails schema-builder SQL generation including defaults and foreign-key conventions, engine block-based table creation, adapter schema dumps preserving primary keys and defaults, ActiveRecord hash-form ordering and populated-table migration round trips, bounded multi-process workload supervision with child reaping, combined production traffic/deadline/cancellation/capacity/deadlock soak validation, release configuration, release tag/changelog preflight, upgrade guards, benchmark execution, executor query deadlines, wire-level cancellation of in-flight requests, standalone SCRAM verification, actual WAL checkpoint sizing, typed deserialization-corruption detection, preservation of stored false values when defaults are present, filesystem fault injection with descriptor cleanup, compaction/reopen validation, process-level replication failover with stale-writer fencing, and live TCP network-partition catch-up and promotion (268 examples, 0 failures at the latest audit).

## Known limitations

- The concurrent workload and regression suite verify parallel appends, point
  reads, scans, durable reopen reads, multi-process server clients, and a
  process-level replication failover drill. This does not certify universal
  capacity; embedded ownership remains exclusive and multi-process clients must
  use the server.

- multi-row SQL `VALUES` inserts execute through the parser, binder, planner,
  and executor, including per-row conflict handling and Rails insert IDs
- incremental backups capture WAL mutations after a verified base LSN; differential backups capture the verified base-relative WAL delta and restore through the same validated delta path
- replication is limited to the explicit logical row-mutation envelope API;
  process replacement, live TCP partition/catch-up, and same-host fencing are
  tested, while true multi-host partitions and split-brain recovery remain
  deployment work
- automatic failover is limited to synchronized candidates; fencing requires a shared durable fence path and still needs multi-host split-brain validation
- the SQLite compatibility profile covers the documented common application
  surface, but it is not SQLite file-format or extension compatibility
- production CA lifecycle, independent security review, performance targets,
  and large-scale workload behavior still require dedicated validation
- branch state application and live target-branch merges are supported through the engine reconciliation hook

## Unsupported SQL

The supported dialect is defined in [docs/sql/compatibility.md](sql/compatibility.md) and enforced by parser/execution integration coverage. RubyDB provides a tested common SQLite-style profile, not complete SQLite file-format, extension, pragma, or error compatibility.

## Durability guarantees

WAL framing, reopen behavior, subprocess crash-recovery scenarios, actual checkpoint sizing, fail-closed visibility-map loading, filesystem fault injection, compaction/reopen behavior, networked replication failover, and verified restore drills are tested. This is not a substitute for real quota, power-loss, and filesystem-specific validation.

## Transaction guarantees

Transaction commit/rollback, MVCC visibility, snapshot isolation behavior, and vacuum safe-point handling are covered by focused tests. High-contention workload validation remains outstanding.

## Isolation guarantees

Read committed, repeatable read, and serializable conflict behavior are covered by focused tests; broader workload and distributed-isolation validation remains outstanding.

## Backup guarantees

Full compressed backups restore into a fresh directory and checksum tampering is detected. Incremental and differential backups validate the base, checksum the change set, and apply WAL row mutations during restore. Production-scale backup-chain and filesystem fault-injection testing remains outstanding.

## Replication guarantees

Logical row-mutation streaming, LSN deduplication, acknowledgments, acknowledged-LSN reporting, synchronized-candidate promotion verification, process replacement, live TCP partition/catch-up, and stale-primary rejection through durable fencing epochs are tested. Multi-host fencing and split-brain recovery still require dedicated validation.

## TLS guarantees

TLS 1.2 or newer is enforced when enabled. Certificate/key parsing, CA-file validation, TLS client connections, and the end-to-end SSL transport path are tested. Mutual TLS is configurable through client certificates; certificate rotation and production CA lifecycle procedures remain operational work.

## Security model

Password and SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication, server-signature verification, read/write authorization, and startup validation of incomplete auth configuration are tested through the server/session path.

## Performance characteristics

The repository includes a deterministic storage benchmark (`RUBYDB_BENCHMARK_ITERATIONS=100 ruby -Ilib benchmarks/basic_workload.rb`) and a concurrent write/durability workload (`ruby benchmarks/concurrent_workload.rb`). Both emit machine-readable JSON. Production-scale throughput, WAL, checkpoint, and concurrency targets still require workload-specific baselines.

## Deployment requirements

The project currently needs:

- a validated Ruby support matrix
- RubyGems publication credentials (`RUBYGEMS_API_KEY`) configured as a protected
  GitHub Actions secret before pushing a release tag
- a documented operator runbook for backups, upgrades, rollback, and incident preservation
- explicit durability and crash-recovery validation
- secure-by-default configuration development
- a narrower set of supported features documented honestly

## Remaining roadmap items

Main remaining work is to complete the sequence laid out in the repository design:

1. production CA lifecycle and certificate rotation
2. broader SQL compatibility contract and workload benchmarks
3. production-grade failover fencing and broader SQL compatibility
4. operator runbooks and deployment validation

## Bottom line

RubyDB has a validated production-oriented foundation, but it does not yet meet
the bar for unrestricted production use with real data outside its documented
feature set and deployment-specific validation.

## Copy/paste local audit

```sh
bundle exec rspec
bundle exec rubocop
ruby scripts/restore_drill
RUBYDB_WORKLOAD_THREADS=8 RUBYDB_WORKLOAD_OPERATIONS=2000 ruby benchmarks/concurrent_workload.rb
```

Attach the output to the release record and replace the workload settings with
values measured on the target deployment.
