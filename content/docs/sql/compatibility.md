# RubyDB SQL compatibility

RubyDB supports a deliberately documented SQL dialect. It includes a tested
SQLite-style compatibility profile for common new Ruby/Rails applications (see
`sqlite-compatibility.md`), but this is not a claim of complete SQLite,
PostgreSQL, or MySQL compatibility.

Supported and tested statements include:

- `SELECT` with projections, `WHERE`, ordering, limits, offsets, built-in
  expressions, and `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX` aggregates (including
  `DISTINCT` aggregate arguments) with
  `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
- window ranking functions `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, and `DENSE_RANK`, plus
  partition-wide and explicit `ROWS`-framed aggregate windows using
  `OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...)`
- `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` for compatible SELECT
  projections
- non-correlated scalar subqueries, `IN (SELECT ...)`, and `EXISTS (SELECT ...)`
  predicates
- materialized non-recursive and bounded recursive `WITH` common table
  expressions
- `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`, including multi-row `VALUES`,
  `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, and targeted `ON CONFLICT (...) DO UPDATE SET ...`
  with `excluded.column`
- `CREATE TABLE` and `DROP TABLE`, including primary keys, unique constraints,
  checks, foreign keys, and referential actions
- `CREATE INDEX`/`CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` and `DROP INDEX`
- `ALTER TABLE` add/drop columns and constraints
- `CREATE`/`DROP DATABASE`, `CREATE`/`DROP SCHEMA`, and `CREATE`/`DROP VIEW`
- supported trigger metadata DDL: `CREATE TRIGGER ... EXECUTE FUNCTION ...`
- `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`, `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`, and
  `RELEASE SAVEPOINT`
- `EXPLAIN`, `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, and `VACUUM`

Unsupported syntax must fail with a parser or execution error. RubyDB does not
promise arbitrary SQL extensions, PostgreSQL wire-level compatibility, or
feature parity with another database engine. The executable contract is the
integration coverage under `spec/`.

## Copy-and-paste compatibility check

Before adopting a query shape, run it in a disposable database and retain the
result as an application test:

```sh
rubydb shell --database tmp/compatibility-check.rdb
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, account_id INTEGER, kind TEXT);
INSERT INTO events (id, account_id, kind) VALUES (1, 10, 'login'), (2, 10, 'purchase');
SELECT account_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM events
GROUP BY account_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

For a feature outside this page, treat a parser/execution error as unsupported
until a documented, tested implementation exists.
