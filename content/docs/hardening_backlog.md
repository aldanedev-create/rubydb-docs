# Remaining production work

Completed checkpoints: exclusive embedded engine ownership, duplicate-open
rejection, release after process exit, initialization failure cleanup, fail-closed
metadata and recovery startup, atomic metadata replacement, and deterministic
background-maintenance shutdown.

The following work remains open; passing the regression suite does not certify
these capabilities.

1. Server concurrency: cancellation and sustained load with latency percentiles.
   Client deadlines are checked before execution and propagated into the query
   executor, which checks during long read phases. Engine transaction state is
   now scoped per client connection thread, and concurrent commit/rollback
   behavior is covered. Multi-process durability is covered; wire-level
   cancellation is now request-scoped and cooperative: a client can send
   a cancel frame while the connection reader remains active, and the server
   acknowledges it only for the active request. Mixed transaction reference-log
   and restart validation remain open.
2. Persistence: fault-test disk-full and interrupted checkpoints/schema changes;
   index metadata load and write errors now fail visibly, and failed schema
   publications roll back in-memory state. Metadata and index catalogs are
   published through unique temporary files with flush/fsync/atomic rename.
   Commit acknowledgements now expose durable versus uncertain WAL state and
   recovery-required post-WAL flush failures. Storage accepts an explicit
   `io_fault_injector` hook for page writes, file extension/truncation, and
   sync operations; those paths now verify typed failures and descriptor
   cleanup. Compaction now reads the engine's actual record-header layout,
   observes dirty buffer-pool pages, and is covered through reopen validation.
   Real filesystem quota and power-loss tests remain environment work.
3. SQL correctness: ambiguous identifiers and broader dialect-specific edge
   cases remain open. Boolean false values, `IS NULL`, NULL comparison behavior, and
   outer-join NULL extension now have regression coverage. Non-recursive CTEs,
   subqueries, set operations, targeted `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`, and
   ranking/partition window functions, explicit `ROWS` window frames, bounded
   recursive CTEs, dependency-aware inner-join reordering, and targetless
   conflict updates using primary/unique definitions are implemented; multi-row
   `VALUES` sources are now atomic when executed outside a caller transaction.
   Broader dialect upsert forms and statistics-driven plan costing remain open.
4. Replication: synchronized acknowledgements and promotion with an explicit
   recovery point. Engine commits now package all committed row changes into a
   single replication envelope after the local WAL commit point. Primary
   connections bootstrap the catalog before row replay, including empty replicas. TCP input now
   uses bounded newline framing and replay positions are fsynced before ack;
   replica engine mutation entry points are read-only except for internal replay.
   Promotion now rejects any received/replayed LSN gap and can require a
   caller-supplied recovery point. Active primary engine mutations validate the
   fencing lease before writing. Replication shutdown now closes established
   replica sockets, and a reconnect/catch-up partition test verifies that the
   replica resumes from the durable log. A process-level failover drill now
   kills and replaces an independent primary, advances the fencing epoch from
   another process, rejects the stale writer, and verifies replica catch-up.
   A reproducible TCP fault-proxy drill now exercises live partition, healing,
   catch-up, fencing, and promotion while the primary remains alive. True
   multi-host partitions, independent fencing infrastructure, and split-brain
   recovery still require deployment validation before adding automatic election.
5. Rails: populated migration round trips, eager loading, nested associations,
   and live adapter coverage are present. CI now exercises Rails 7.1, 7.2, and
   8.0 against the adapter; connection-pool behavior and each version's
   compatibility result still require hosted-run evidence. Migration
   tracking now uses stable content checksums and fails closed for changed or
   missing applied migrations. Native and ActiveRecord schema dumps now
   round-trip automatic/custom primary-key modes, defaults, and indexes through
   live engines.
6. Operations: backup manifest writes now use durable atomic publication, live
   engines flush WAL/storage before physical backup, and a scheduled restore
   drill reopens restored files. Upgrade tests, measured resource limits,
   alerting, and full security review remain open. Replication peers now
   support constant-time shared-token authentication when configured; TLS and
   credential rotation procedures still require deployment validation.

7. Release engineering: cross-platform Ruby 3.3/3.4 CI, Rails 7.1/7.2/8.0
   adapter jobs, and a deterministic bounded fuzz safety workflow are wired
   into GitHub Actions. CI enforces 25% line and 20% branch coverage (the
   current audit measured 62.0% line and 32.84% branch). Release provenance
   signing is enabled, RubyGems gem-level signing requires protected
   key/certificate paths, tag/changelog preflight fails closed, dependency
   audit runs weekly, and tag releases can publish generated GitHub release
   notes. A maintainer must still provision the RubyGems signing secrets and
   review generated notes before publication.

Deployment tests must record the commit, platform, workload and measured
results. Keep untested features marked as unvalidated.

## Latest documentation checkpoint

The current repository also ships a tested common SQLite-style compatibility
profile, a durability release gate, Prometheus alert rules, a multi-node Docker
topology manifest, a production runbook, and a release checklist. The lessons
from these hardening changes are collected in
[`docs/lessons-learned.md`](lessons-learned.md). These artifacts improve
repeatability but do not replace hosted multi-host, physical-filesystem, or
independent security validation.

## Copy/paste hardening baseline

Run the deterministic local checks before treating a checkpoint as complete:

```sh
bundle exec rspec
ruby scripts/durability_drill
ruby scripts/restore_drill
ruby scripts/security
```

The security script requires `bundler-audit`; physical quota, power-loss,
multi-host fencing, and independent review still require deployment evidence.
